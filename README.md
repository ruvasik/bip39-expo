# BIP39 expo
This wrapped [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39) package for work in expo projects.

This solves problem "_Secure random number generation is not supported by this browser.
Use Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer 11_" and "_Not found module Stream/Buffer_" if you try use raw bip39 in your expo app.
